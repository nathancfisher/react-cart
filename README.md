React-Cart: A Simple E-Commerce App

This is a practice project built to solidify my understanding of the modern React ecosystem. The application is a single-page e-commerce store that focuses on core state management and routing concepts.
Features

    Dynamic Product Display: Fetches product data from a local JSON file to simulate an API.

    Shopping Cart: A fully functional shopping cart managed by a global Redux store.

    Quantity Control: Users can add or remove multiple quantities of an item before adding it to the cart.

    Product Search: A search bar to filter products on the homepage.

    Client-Side Routing: Navigates between the homepage, a product detail page, and the cart using React Router.

Technologies Used

    React: The core library for building the user interface.

    Redux Toolkit: For predictable and scalable global state management.

    React Router: For handling client-side routing.

    React Hooks: Leverages useState, useEffect, and other hooks for managing component-level logic.
